#+TITLE: Autonomous agents in SDL

* What is this ?
This is a port of the Flocking project I started in Qt. For learning
purposes, I now feel like using SDL is better than using the Qt graphics
pipeline I don't totally understand now. Also, it will provide an easy way to
compare implementations.

* TODOs/Wishlist
  - [ ] Create a skeleton game loop with generic callbacks implemented
  - [ ] Consider using Eigen3 for the linear algebra
    - [ ] Does SDL2 bring its accessible, wide-purposed linear algebra API ??
  - [ ] Make the abstraction graph for ants and food
  - [ ] Draw one ant and one food
    - [ ] How to 'store' the vision of each ant ? (Not interesting until
      behaviours are implemented)
  - [ ] Implement movement (straight line) - test game loop updates
  - [ ] Implement world wraping and wooming in/out
  - [ ] Implement behaviours for ants
