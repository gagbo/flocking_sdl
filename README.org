#+TITLE: Autonomous agents in SDL

* What is this ?
This is a port of the Flocking project I started in Qt. For learning
purposes, I now feel like using SDL is better than using the Qt graphics
pipeline I don't totally understand now. Also, it will provide an easy way to
compare implementations.

* TODOs/Wishlist
  - [-] Create a skeleton game loop with generic callbacks implemented.
    Only the keyboard/mouse input is missing
  - [ ] Fix the issue with shipping data with binaries (will probably be
    hell)
  - [X] Consider using Eigen3 for the linear algebra
    - [X] Does SDL2 bring its accessible, wide-purposed linear algebra API ??
      - It does not look like it, so Eigen3 will be used
  - [ ] Make the abstraction graph for ants and food
    - The position will be an Eigen3 2d vector
    - These classes need to know the address of the MainWindow they'll draw
      to
      - The MainWindow class provides add_XXX_to_renderer methods to actually
      ship the position to the renderer
    - These classes need to work with the static World:: constants
      - The width/height to know how to generate correct random values for
      insertion
      - The time-step value in order to correctly update the velocity
  - [-] Draw one ant and one food
    - [X] Ant done
    - [ ] Create a superclass to inherit update() from ?
    - [ ] How to 'store' the vision of each ant ? (Not interesting until
      behaviours are implemented)
  - [X] Implement movement (straight line) - test game loop updates
  - [X] Implement world wrapping... 
  - [ ] ... and zooming in/out
  - [ ] Implement behaviours for ants
