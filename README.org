* What is this ?
This is a port of the [[https://github.com/gagbo/Flocking][Flocking project]]
I started in Qt. For learning
purposes, I now feel like using SDL is better than using the Qt graphics
pipeline I don't totally understand now. Also, it will provide an easy way to
compare implementations.

The project is still very "dirty" as I use this as a playground while
discovering SDL capabilities. As such, for the time being issues and PR
I did not author will be ignored, and pushes will be made to master until
a working version of the project is reached (i.e. a working swarm of ants
as in [[https://github.com/gagbo/Flocking][Flocking]] )

* Dependencies
  - Eigen3 for linear algebra
  - SDL2 for the renderer
  - SDL2_image

* How to play with it
The current CMake configuration overrides the default install location,
so there are no system implications about making the install target.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make install
./install/bin/flocks
#+END_SRC

* TODOs/Wishlist
  - [-] Create a skeleton game loop with generic callbacks implemented.
    Only the keyboard/mouse input is missing
  - [ ] Fix the issue with shipping data with binaries (will probably be
    hell)
  - [X] Consider using Eigen3 for the linear algebra
    - [X] Does SDL2 bring its accessible, wide-purposed linear algebra API ??
      - It does not look like it, so Eigen3 will be used
  - [-] Make the abstraction graph for ants and food
    - The position will be an Eigen3 2d vector
    - These classes need to know the address of the MainWindow they'll draw
      to
      - The MainWindow class provides add_XXX_to_renderer methods to actually
      ship the position to the renderer
  - [-] Draw one ant and one food
    - [X] Ant done
    - [X] Create a superclass to inherit update() from ?
    - [ ] How to 'store' the vision of each ant ? (Not interesting until
      behaviours are implemented)
      - The World class is responsible for gathering neighbourhoods of
        entities (this will most likely be the computational bottleneck)
      - Write tests for the k-d tree implementation
      - Complete k-d tree implementation
  - [X] Implement movement (straight line) - test game loop updates
  - [X] Implement world wrapping... 
  - [ ] ... and zooming in/out
  - [ ] Use Viewports to create a World zone and a status zone in the window
  - [ ] Implement behaviours for ants
